## 📖 Overview

The **Credpal App** is a Flutter application designed with **Clean Architecture** principles.
While the app currently consists of UI designs based on a provided *

**, it is structured in a way that allows easy expansion into a fully functional commerce
application.

This project follows the **Domain-Layered Clean Architecture** approach, ensuring maintainability,
scalability, and separation of concerns.

## 🏛️ Clean Architecture Structure

This project follows the **Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture** principle, splitting the codebase into
well-defined layers:

### **1. Presentation Layer (UI & Widgets)**

- Contains UI elements built using Flutter widgets.
- Handles animations using **flutter_animate**.

This architecture ensures:
✅ **Separation of Concerns** (each layer has a single responsibility)
✅ **Scalability** (easy to add features without affecting other layers)
✅ **Testability** (independent layers allow for unit testing)
